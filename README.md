# Airport pattern

A pattern for the 201 Pocket Piano inspired by
[Pd for Airports](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sTrn39TT7k)
which was itself inspired by Brian Eno's
"Music for Airports".

Hold down a note. It will be recorded to a loop of somewhere between
3 and 6 times its length, and continue looping.
