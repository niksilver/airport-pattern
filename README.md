# Airport pattern

A pattern for the 201 Pocket Piano inspired by
[Pd for Airports](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sTrn39TT7k)
which was itself inspired by Brian Eno's
["Music for Airports"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambient_1:_Music_for_Airports).

Hold down a note. It will be recorded to a "tape" loop of somewhere between
4 and 7 times its length, and continue looping. Hold down another note.
It will be recorded to another tape loop, and also continue looping.

You can add up to six notes in total. Additional notes will replace earlier
notes with new tapes.

You can stop a single tape by quickly pressing the note associated with
that tape. You can stop all tapes by quickly pressing and releasing
any two notes together (they don't have to be associated with any tapes).
